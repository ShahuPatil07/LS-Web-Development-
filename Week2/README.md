# WEEK TWO

Hello everyone. Hope you all are excited to start week 2 and end your frontend basics. We are here to help you in navigating this section.

 - **Start with reading [Frameworks](./Frameworks.md)**

   Learning frameworks helps in making your website look amazing without much effort. Bootstrap is one of the frameworks which will make your website look more presentable and cool.
   
 - **Next learn [React](./Reactjs.md)**

   This is the frontend framework you are going to use for your projects. There are other frameworks like Angular or Vue , but React is more popular and used by a lot of companies to make reusable components. You can create your custom tags called as components (It's fascinating to make your own tags like you all use h1 tags now use < MyHeading /> ).
