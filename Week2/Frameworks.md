# CSS Frameworks

Now, you all know what HTML,CSS and basics of JS is and yesss!! You have already installed React JS. But before working on React, we are going to study the external **CSS frameworks**…

Why?? Well because we told you to do so ! **Just kidding**.. Well let me show you one example of a website layout formed using conventional CSS and external framework.. Then don’t ask me why..hehe..

*In the images section: Go to bootstrap example and conventional example..For a similar layout you need to write so much html + css . But the same thing can be done by an external framework like bootstrap so easily.You need not remember all the classes , they are already present on their official website !! The beautiful thing is that it is responsive….. External frameworks provide classes which are already responsive so you don’t need to add by yourself those “media queries”.*

So let us start with **Bootstrap**. If you have time you can learn Tailwind too (completely-optional). We will provide resources for both.

## **Bootstrap**

**Bootstrap** is a free and open-source collection of CSS and JavaScript/jQuery code used for creating dynamic websites layout and web applications. Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks which has a really nice set of predefined CSS codes. Bootstrap uses different types of classes to make responsive websites.

You can see the official website’s introduction : [Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).. One thing to note is that a framework is continuously evolving. With time there will be new things added so we are going to dive into the general parts as we have to learn loads of new things this week. So in future if you find something new just google it or maybe look it up on the official website. No need to worry !

- **Setting up Bootstrap:**

    - **CDN:** CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a system of distributed servers that deliver pages and other web content to a user.CDN links are URLs that point to these servers to quickly deliver resources needed for loading Internet content. Basically if you do not want to download any stuff just include these links in your code and your website will work : [Introduction](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/). It includes how to use CDN links.

    - **Alternatives**: You can follow these but for now they are just extra for you. Just use CDN whenever possible. [Download](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/)

- **Websites to follow (any one):**

  - **[Official Website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) (You can read the docs here but let me tell you: there is no need to remember all these customisations,layouts,navbars.. Just what you can do is to go on the section you want to incorporate in your website and read about it and use it. )**

  - **[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-tooltips/?ref=roadmap) (This is extra. You can see this if you were following this website previously. Most of the time ,just stick to the official websites in my opinion. If you do not understand then just google that term.)**

- **Videos:**

  - **[All components](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR&feature=shared) - How to use most of them ? (Video number: 3 to 20) ( Well you can just see what you wanna try , but why not try all !! )**

  - **[In Hindi+Project](https://youtu.be/nPxCYOO1e44?feature=shared)**

  - **[Old Video: Only for concept..](https://youtu.be/vpAJ0s5S2t0?feature=shared)**

There are 100’s of resources already. But in web development, you need practice. Create your own websites based on different themes.. You can get themes, navbar ideas , layout ideas on the official website : [Theme](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/).

In the end, this is just a framework which you can use in your websites to make it more pretty and responsive.

## **Tailwind (Completely Optional)** ##

**Tailwind** CSS is an open-source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.

For example, in other traditional systems, there would be a class message-warning that would apply a yellow background color and bold text. To achieve this result in Tailwind, one would have to apply a set of classes created by the library: bg-yellow-300 and font-bold.
