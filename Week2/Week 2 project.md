# Week 2 Assignment : Notes keeping website üìù

## Objective:
- Create a frontend-only website similar to Google Keep, a popular note-taking app, using React.js and Bootstrap CSS. The website should have a toggle switch to switch between dark and light modes.

## Requirements:

### Note-taking functionality:
- Create a website that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes.
- Each note should have a title, content, and a delete button.
- Users should be able to add new notes and edit existing ones.
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
Implement a toggle switch that allows users to switch between dark and light modes.
The toggle switch should be easily accessible and visible on the website.
When the user switches modes, the website's layout, colors, and typography should change accordingly.

#### UI/UX:
- The website should have a clean and minimalistic design, similar to Google Keep.
- Use Bootstrap CSS to style the website and make it ' responsive '.
- Ensure that the website is accessible and **usable on different devices and screen sizes**

#### React.js implementation:
- Use React.js to build the website's frontend.
- Implement state management using React Hooks (e.g., useState, useContext).
- Use React components to break down the website's UI into reusable pieces.

## Constraints:
No backend:
- This assignment focuses on frontend development only. You are not advised to be building a backend API or storing data on a server.
Local storage:
- Use local storage (e.g., localStorage) to store notes data. This means that notes will be lost when the user closes the browser or clears local storage.
No authentication:
- This assignment does not require user authentication or authorization.

## Deliverables:
A working website that meets the requirements above.
A GitHub repository containing the website's code.
A README file that explains how to run the website and any dependencies required.

### Tips and resources:
Use Bootstrap's built-in dark mode classes to simplify the dark mode implementation.
Consider using a React libraries to manage state across components.
For local storage, you can use the localStorage API or a library like react-local-storage.

## Submission:
Please submit your assignment as a GitHub repository link and a README file explaining how to run the website. Make sure to include your name, student ID, and assignment title in the README file.
