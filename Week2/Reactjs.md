# Week-2 LS DEV (React.js) 
&nbsp;               

Welcome back to Week 2 of our course on Web Development with React.js. This week, we will dive deeper into the world of React.js, exploring its core features and components. By now, you should already be familiar with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript concepts. You’ve also installed React.js, which is fantastic! Let’s dive into learning React.js with a focus on understanding its core concepts and building practical applications.

&nbsp;Our aim is to help you become proficient in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using React.js.

So, let's get on with it!

## React vs HTML – Can You Spot a Difference?
&nbsp;               
HTML is a markup language while React is a JavaScript library. Both are used in front-end development and you might have heard about them while designing websites or web apps. Let’s see what’s the difference between HTML and React.
Key takeaways:
•	HTML is a markup language, while React is a JS library.
•	React is component-based, while HTML doesn’t support such a structure by default.
•	HTML can’t manage interactivity or states on its own; React can manage states.
•	HTML websites need full refresh, while React can update only elements that change.
•	React enables one-way data binding, while HTML doesn’t have any data binding by default.
•	HTML typically structures content for static websites. React builds dynamic app UIs.

- **Which is faster React or HTML?**
- React is often considered faster than traditional HTML due to its use of a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM allows React to efficiently update only the necessary components when there are changes, minimizing the number of actual manipulations on the web page. This optimized approach leads to improved performance and faster rendering times compared to manually manipulating the DOM with HTML.

- **Introduction to React.js**

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application effectively.

React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
