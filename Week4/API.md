Application Programming Interface (API):

Application Programming Interface is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them. A programmer can make use of various API tools to make their program easier and simpler.

Different architectures of API are used worldwide . The most popular ones are listed here : [API Architecture](https://medium.com/@masterrajpatel/top-6-most-popular-api-architecture-styles-99a061ee87e3) .

We are going to work with restful API : REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and follows the constraints of REST architecture allowing interaction with RESTful web services. It defines a set of functions (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) that clients use to access server data. Its main feature is that REST API is stateless, i.e., the servers do not save clients' data between requests.
