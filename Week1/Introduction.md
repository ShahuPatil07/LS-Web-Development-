# Web Development: Introduction

## **Networking Basics**

First of all, do you know how communication takes place over the internet ? If not then here is a basic flow of [Communication](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_http.asp).

Now let us understand what we are going to study.

**Web development:** It refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:

- **Web:** It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.

- **Development:** It refers to building the application from scratch.

**Web Development can be classified into two ways:**

- Frontend : [Roadmap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220825163009/Front-End-Frameworks-and-Libraries1.png)

- Backend : [Roadmap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210309162115/Backend-design-roadmap.jpeg)

**During these four weeks we are going to learn React-Django and additional CSS frameworks.**

## **Code Editors (Where you will write your code)**

*You can use any of these based on your preference. We will be doing in VS Code.*

1. Notepad or TextEdit

2. Visual Studio Code :

- [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- [Emmet \
](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet)

    Few important emmets

    - ! : You can create HTML file and write your first letter '!' and press enter. You will have a HTML boiler plate ready for use.

    - lorem : Just write lorem and press enter and you will get some dummy words. Also if you want like 34 words, you just need to type lorem34 and it will give 34 dummy words!

    - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) Once you activate live server. You need not to reload your website. Just go live and everytime you save your changes in VS Code, it gets automatically updated in your web browser.

3.  [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) 

## **HTML**

## **CSS**

CSS (Cascading Styling Sheet) is the language that defines the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is the language that transforms a basic HTML structure into a user-friendly and visually beautiful webpage. It can change the font, color, size, and spacing of content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other features.

  *CSS is really a vast topic. We will also cover one or two CSS frameworks later in LearnerSpace. So just be comfortable with the basics , do the 
  assignments and learn more and more.*

## **Javascript**

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive. It adds dynamic functionality and complex features like interactivity and animation to web pages. Together with HTML and CSS, JavaScript forms the foundation of web development. When a web page does more than just display static information, such as showing timely content updates, interactive maps, or animated graphics, JavaScript is likely involved. It allows you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, and perform various other tasks.

- **Websites to follow for basic JS (any one):**

    - **[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)** **(JS is itself a programming language: (** *So Do I need to study a whole new programming language for web dev umm NO !!* **) You will learn new concepts while trying new frameworks so don’t worry just try to complete the tutorial part):**

        - **Basics like variable ,operations, loops,string ,array**

        - **DOM Model (present in a section in website)**

        - **Events , async ,objects (be clear with getter,setter,event creation,arrow functions,map,filter,spread)**

- **Videos:**

    - **[CS50](https://youtu.be/x5trGVMKTdY?feature=shared)** **(Really great video to understand basic requirements) and [Programming with Mosh](https://youtu.be/W6NZfCO5SIk?feature=shared)  (Timestamp: from 16:11 to end) {Both are equally good but if you were watching CS50 then continue with it}**

    - **[Summary](https://youtu.be/lkIFF4maKMU?feature=shared)**

    - **[All Topics(basic to adv)](https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg?feature=shared)** **(freecodecamp has provided this video. If you have time then only watch this, it just has so much depth that’s why a long video)**

    - **[Playlist in hindi](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg&feature=shared)** **(Videos numbered 46 to 62)**

## **We will be moving forward with the frontend framework: React.js . So you will get a clear idea about what else is required in JS. But be clear with the concepts provided in this doc..**
