# WEEK THREE

Hello everyone. Hope you all are excited to start week 3 and start your backend development. We are here to help you in navigating this section.

 - **Read [Backend Development](./Backend.md)**

   You have learnt frontend dev. Now it's time for backend. Understand the concepts and emerge as a fullstack developer.
 
 **Please do [Assignment](./Assignment.md). This is not a hard assignment as you will be only learning backend this week. Be ready to integrate your frontend and backend in the final week (next one) and show your new skills to everyone.**

 
 

### ⚠️ [Week 3 Assignment](./Assignment.md)  is a crucial part of the final project, and Week 4 Assignment will be extended upon this.

Hope you had fun learning frontend with us.
